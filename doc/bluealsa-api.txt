Methods         array{object, dict} GetPCMs()

                        Returns the array of available PCM objects and
                        associated properties.

                        Signal emitted when new PCM is added. It contains
                        the object path and associated properties.

                void PCMRemoved(object path)

                        Signal emitted when device has been removed. The
                        object path is only for a reference - it has been
