Object path     [variable prefix]/

Methods         array{object, dict} GetPCMs()

                        Returns the array of available PCM objects and
                        associated properties.

Signals         void PCMAdded(object path, dict props)

                        Signal emitted when new PCM is added. It contains
                        the object path and associated properties.

                void PCMRemoved(object path)

                        Signal emitted when device has been removed. The
                        object path is only for a reference - it has been
                        already removed.

Methods         fd, fd Open(string mode)

                        Open PCM stream in a given operation mode. This method
                        returns two file descriptors, respectively PCM stream
                        PIPE and PCM controller SEQPACKET socket.

                        Controller socket commands: "Drain", "Drop", "Pause",
                                                    "Resume"

                        Possible Errors: dbus.Error.InvalidArguments
