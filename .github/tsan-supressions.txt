# TSAN detects some issues within libdbus-1 library:
# 1. It detects a cycle in lock order graph when the connection dispatch
#    is called after dbus_bus_get_private().
deadlock:dbus_bus_get_private
# 2. It does not like calling dbus_connection_send_with_reply_and_block()
#    while other thread is calling dbus_connection_dispatch().
